Instructions:

Tap on a team name to select that team and enable the score buttons.

If user taps on Touchdown button the Extra Point and Two Point Conversion buttons will be enabled.



Notes: 
I may have gone a little overboard, but this was fun.

Point values are stored in button tags, which are then passed along and extracted so they team's score can be calculated. 

This went through a few much less complicated versions, I'm pretty happy with it now. I'd like it to be prettier, but I don't have an eye for that sort of thing (yet). 

Tested on a virtual Nexus One and real-life Nexus 5X.
